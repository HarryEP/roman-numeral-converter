# roman-numeral-converter

## Set up

Run `pip3 install -r "requirements.txt"` in your terminal before starting.

## Run program

The maximum and minimum roman numerals are -3999 and 3999 as I currently don't want to break any principles of roman numeral conversion.

Run main.py and choose a number to convert from word to numeral (for now)
